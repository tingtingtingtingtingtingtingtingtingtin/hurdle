# Hurdle

Welcome to **Hurdle**, the Wordle clone where you _don't_ want to guess the word!

The goal of Hurdle is to come up with as many valid words as possible that **do not** match the target word. Test your vocabulary and outwit the hurdles along the way!


## Tech Stack

Hurdle leverages modern web development tools for optimal performance and scalability:

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** with **Vite** for fast builds and development.
   - Styled using plain CSS
- **Backend**: A lightweight **Express.js** server handles API requests.
- **Wordle API**: Word data is fetched from this open-source Wordle API: [Wordle API](https://github.com/petergeorgas/Wordle-API/commit/4cd62c67c781713c01ae1e1bd3e82eb2bf1ecfdb).
